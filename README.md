# Tax-Preparation-App
Code repo for tax preparation application

I am thrilled to propose a solution for your tax application needs using Flutter and Firebase for the app development, and Angular and Firebase for the backend console. This combination of technologies will ensure a cost-effective, high-performance solution.
Flutter is renowned for its efficiency in developing cross-platform applications. Its single codebase architecture enables us to write the application code once and deploy it on both Android and iOS platforms. This not only speeds up the development process but also reduces the cost significantly.
Firebase is a powerful platform that offers a wide array of features such as authentication, real-time database, and cloud storage. It also provides robust security measures to protect users' sensitive financial information.
For the backend console, I propose using Angular, a platform known for its speed and performance in building single-page applications. Coupled with Firebase, it will allow us to create a secure, scalable and user-friendly backend for your application.
This solution will provide a seamless, user-friendly experience similar to TurboTax. Furthermore, it will ensure the secure handling of user data, a critical feature for a financial application.
I'm confident that this approach will result in a high-quality, cost-effective tax application that exceeds your expectations. I look forward to discussing this proposal in more detail.

## App Proposal
Webapp using Angular with a Firebase Firestore backend
